                    I started my first week by discussing in class my major project’s research question, and established what I have to do over the first week. 
                    I discussed with my lecturer and concluded that my research question is too broad and I should narrow it down and concentrate on a specific niche in the restaurants industry. 
                    I chose to research the user experience on Italian restaurants form England, to see what they all have in common, how they differ and how I can get a badly designed website for an Italian restaurant and use what I will learn in my 13 weeks research and improve its overall usability and aesthetics to make it more user friendly, with the aim of bringing more users to the website and make them want to return and use my online services.

                    As a tool to my research for Italian restaurants in England I used a popular website called TripAdvisor where people cand leave reviews to different attractions around the country including restaurants. By the end of the week, I managed to find 25 Italian restaurants around the country and look at their similarities and how they differ depending on their food choices, the size of the dining area, where they are located, and their online rating by customers.

                    I wrote to 5 different restaurants from different locations and asked the owners if they would like to take part in my research by discussing with me in a short interview about their restaurants and their website, they use to advertise their business online. So far, none of the owners have replied to me.

                    In the second week we meet back in class with my colleagues and professor and discussed our assignments from the previous week. 
                    The previous week I wrote to several Italian restaurants to try and persuade them to take part in my research, but by the end of the first week I haven’t got any reply.

                <p class="content__text-paragraph">
                    I presented my email that I sent to the restaurants owners to try and persuade them to take part in my research and to allow me to use their websites as reference.
                    We discussed my approach to the Italian restaurants owners and we came to the conclusion that the email I have sent might intriguing enough and that I might have to change my approach if I want to get their attention.  
                </p>
                <p class="content__text-paragraph">
                    In the class we have discussed this matter as another colleague of mine has the same problem like me and we concluded that our attempt to capture the attention of a business owner has to be short and conclusive, to draw their interest and to pitch my intentions in a way that the owners will find it worth according me their time. 

                     I took in account what we discussed in my last session and I wrote an email to several small Italian restaurants with the intention of capturing their interest and attention. 

                 One of the Italian restaurants replied to me telling me that they already have a company that they pay to have their website created and maintained, but they allow me to use their website as a reference.
