                    I started my first week by discussing in class my major project’s research question and established what do I have to do over the first week. 
                    I discussed with my lecturer and concluded that my research question is too broad and I should narrow it down and concentrate on a specific niche in the restaurant industry. I, therefore, decided to modify my major project proposal to reflect what we have discussed in class and resubmit it. I chose to research the user experience of small Italian restaurants from England, to see what they all have in common, how they differ, and how can I get a badly designed website for an Italian restaurant and use what I will learn in my 13 weeks of research to improve its overall usability and aesthetics to make it more user friendly, with the aim of bringing more users to the website and make them want to return and use my online services.

                <p class="content__text-paragraph">
                    As a tool for my research for Italian restaurants in England, I will use a popular website called TripAdvisor where people can leave reviews to different attractions around the country including restaurants. 
                </p>
                <p class="content__text-paragraph">
                    For the rest of the week, I concentrate on reviewing my major project proposal to reflect what we have discussed in class. I also started looking for small Italian restaurants to see what they all have in common and start thinking about how can I improve their usability.

                <p class="content__text-paragraph">
                    In the second week, I was still reviewing my major project proposal and I managed to find 20 small Italian restaurants around the country.

                <p class="content__text-paragraph">
                    In next week's class, we discuss our progress, and what is my next step. I concluded that in order for me to better understand how a small Italian restaurant works, I should try and get in contact with them and find out what does it means to be in this business and if they noticed an increase in customers since they deployed their websites.

                <p class="content__text-paragraph">
                    For the rest of the week, I worked on my resubmission and I have emailed 8 restaurants from my list to try and get in touch with them and schedule an interview.

                    Over the past week, I try to get in contact with most of my chosen restaurants but none of them seem to be interested in taking part in my research. In class, we discussed my progress and concluded that my approach is not working and that I should change the way I am trying to get them interested in my research.
                </p>
                <p class="content__text-paragraph">
                    For the rest of the week, I was writing emails and phone the restaurants for them to meet with me. Eventually, I managed to get in contact with a restaurant and they allowed me to use their website as a reference in my research.

                    On week four I started my research for users to take part in my research. For my research to be as close as possible to the real world I wanted my recruits to be of different ages, different needs, and backgrounds.

                <p class="content__text-paragraph">
                    For the rest of the week, I was working on my first website and searched for recruits to take part in my research. By the end of the week, I managed to finish my first website but still didn’t find enough people for my research.
