                    In the fifth week, I start looking for popular Italian restaurants to see what UX, UI features and trends they all have in common, and what can I Implement on my website to increase the number of customers who are looking for a place to dine in. I identify several trends and features and separate them into two main categories: Aesthetic trends and features and Functionality trends and features. 
                </p>
                <p class="content__text-paragraph">
                    By the end of the fifth week, I have managed to recruit 23 people to take part in my research and ask them questions about their previous experiences with restaurant’s websites, what are their preferences and what do they look for when trying to find a place to dine in. 
                </p>
                <p class="content__text-paragraph">
                    By asking these questions, helped me create tasks for them to complete on my websites, starting with the first website.  
                </p>

                <h2 class="content__header-secondary">Week 6</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="content__text">
                <p class="content__text-paragraph">
                    Once I had my tasks ready for my recruits, I meet with them throughout the week and introduced them to my first website and observed them completing their tasks on my first website. 
                </p>
                <p class="content__text-paragraph">
                    To do that, proved to be quite a challenge as I had to meet with each of them in their spare time. But, by the end of the week, I managed to get all my recruits to complete their tasks, get their feedback, and that gave me grounds to start working on my second and third websites.

            <div class="content__text">
                <p class="content__text-paragraph">
                    In week seven we discussed in class my progress and what my next step should be. I start designing my second website by looking at the aesthetic features and trends that I found in popular Italian restaurants, and used my recruit’s feedback and previous experiences to choose the content.  
                </p>
                <p class="content__text-paragraph">
                    After I finished the design of the website, I start building it. Creating the website, was a time-consuming job, spending around 4 to 5 hours every day writing the code. By the end of the week, I managed to build four pages for the website.

            <div class="content__text">
                <p class="content__text-paragraph">
                    Week eight I spent it working on my websites. By the middle of the week, I finished my second website and I went over it to make sure that it is working on all screen sizes and I used Netlify to publish it. 
                    After I finished with the second website, I started working on my third one.
                </p>
                <p class="content__text-paragraph">
                    For the third one, I had to do some further research as I needed to implement a booking system. I found that if I want to implement one that is connected to the database, I need to have the website published and the restaurant registered. I, therefore, created a form with fields for the users to fill in, similar to those found on restaurant’s websites, and when my recruits submit the form, an alert will confirm their reservation.
