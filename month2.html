                    I started my first week by discussing in class my major project’s research question, and established what I have to do over the first week. 
                    I discussed with my lecturer and concluded that my research question is too broad and I should narrow it down and concentrate on a specific niche in the restaurants industry. I chose to research the user experience on Italian restaurants form England, to see what they all have in common, how they differ and how I can get a badly designed website for an Italian restaurant and use what I will learn in my 13 weeks research and improve its overall usability and aesthetics to make it more user friendly, with the aim of bringing more users to the website and make them want to return and use my online services.

                    As a tool to my research for Italian restaurants in England I used a popular website called TripAdvisor where people cand leave reviews to different attractions around the country including restaurants. By the end of the week, I managed to find 25 Italian restaurants around the country and look at their similarities and how they differ depending on their food choices, the size of the dining area, where they are located, and their online rating by customers.

                <p class="content__text-paragraph">
                    I wrote to 5 different restaurants from different locations and asked the owners if they would like to take part in my research by discussing with me in a short interview about their restaurants and their website, they use to advertise their business online. So far, none of the owners have replied to me yet.
